I absolutely love ceramics and one day hope to have a complete studio with a gas kiln to continue working on my pottery and improve as much as possible. I would've loved to be able to enter #justusandclayiamin by doing something wheelthrown as that is what I am most comfortable with, however I did enjoy handbuilding and carving this bottle! #justusandclay  #ceramics
